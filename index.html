                <p><strong>Lab 1.3</strong> is the first hands-on experimentation day where students conduct structured experiments with Alia (Textual AI). Through nine guided experiments, students test capabilities (explanation, creativity, instruction-following) and limitations (real-time information, visual processing, time tracking). Students document observations in field journals using scientific methodology, developing skills in systematic observation, hypothesis testing, and evidence-based reasoning.</p>
